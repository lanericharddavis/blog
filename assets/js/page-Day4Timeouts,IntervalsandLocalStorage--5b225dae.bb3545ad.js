The two that stand out most to me are "Reinventing the Wheel" and "Picking the First Solution".  "Reinventing the Wheel" seems obvious but I often find myself struggling over how to write something or solve a problem when there is an ocean of resources at my desposal(the world wide web).  Web development is a unique field of work because there are plenty of open source resources we can use for help. Instead of trying to muscle your way through something, use your resources, maybe there is an easier way of solving your task.  The second takeaway "Picking the First Solution" is mostly because of my novice status.  When writing code, especially code that ACTUALLY WORKS, I am so thrilled about my vicory that I get attached to my code and think this HAS to be the best way to write/solve this.  In reality, most of the time, I just used the most basic way and there are countless better, more efficent ways to produce the same functionality of what I wrote.  In due time, better and more efficient methods will be learned and I will grow as a developer, but that should never stop you from taking a step back from your work and asking yourself, "Is there a way I can make this better?"')]),e._v(" "),a("br"),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"slapgame-afternoon-challenge-live-link"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#slapgame-afternoon-challenge-live-link"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" SlapGame Afternoon Challenge live link:")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("https://lanericharddavis.github.io/slapGame/")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=s.exports}}]);
